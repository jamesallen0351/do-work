# Do Work README.md

This is a repo for me to do work in

Working on Python practice problems

There is no real rythm to this repo or notebook

I think I am going to use this repo for any scratchwork I need to do

Going to work on some SQL Zoo practice problems and save them to a .txt file

Brought in some Seinfeld episode data to work with in a notebook

Also working on some Hackerrank SQL problems, in no particular order
