/* SQL Zoo Practice SELECT Nobel */

/* We continue practicing simple SQL queries on a single table.

This tutorial is concerned with a table of Nobel prize winners:

nobel(yr, subject, winner)
Using the SELECT statement.*/

/*  1. Change the query shown so that it displays Nobel prizes for 1950. */

SELECT yr, subject, winner FROM nobel
 WHERE yr = 1950;

 /* 2. Show who won the 1962 prize for Literature. */

 SELECT winner
  FROM nobel
 WHERE yr = 1962
   AND subject = 'Literature';

/* Show the year and subject that won 'Albert Einstein' his prize. */

SELECT yr, subject FROM nobel
where winner = 'Albert Einstein';

/* 4. Give the name of the 'Peace' winners since the year 2000, including 2000. */

SELECT winner FROM nobel 
WHERE subject = 'Peace' AND yr >= '2000'

/* 5. Show all details (yr, subject, winner) of the Literature prize winners for 1980 to 1989 inclusive. */

SELECT * FROM nobel
WHERE subject = 'Literature' AND yr BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989;
