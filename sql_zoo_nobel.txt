   AND subject = 'Literature';

/* Show the year and subject that won 'Albert Einstein' his prize. */

SELECT yr, subject FROM nobel
where winner = 'Albert Einstein';

/* 4. Give the name of the 'Peace' winners since the year 2000, including 2000. */

SELECT winner FROM nobel 
WHERE subject = 'Peace' AND yr >= '2000'
