profitable = True

savings = 100
growth_multiplier = 1.1
desc = "compound interest"

# Assign product of savings and growth_multiplier to year1
year1 = savings * growth_multiplier

# Print the type of year1
type(year1)

# Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc
doubledesc = sum(desc) + desc

# Print out doubledesc
print(doubledesc)
